**Executive Summary**

**Healthcare Enterprise Commerce Simulation – QA Framework**

The Healthcare Enterprise Commerce Simulation Platform is a portfolio-based enterprise system designed to simulate a large-scale healthcare eCommerce ecosystem integrated with Order Management (OMS), Warehouse Management (WMS), and ERP systems.

The objective of this repository is to demonstrate structured Quality Assurance governance across Agile feature delivery and controlled regression-based release cycles.

**This simulation represents a multi-module commerce environment including:**

- Product catalog and pricing management

- Customer registration and authentication

- Shopping cart and checkout workflows

- Payment gateway validation

- Order lifecycle tracking

- Warehouse inventory synchronization

- ERP financial reconciliation

- Returns and refund management

**Delivery Model**

The project follows a hybrid delivery approach:

- Agile sprint-based development for feature increments

- Structured regression validation prior to each production release

- Risk-based prioritization for critical commerce workflows

- Cross-system integration testing across OMS, WMS, and ERP

**QA Strategy Overview**

Quality Assurance activities are designed to ensure:

- Full traceability between requirements, test cases, and defects

- Validation of business-critical revenue and inventory workflows

- Integration testing across interconnected systems

- SLA-driven defect lifecycle governance

- Release readiness sign-off supported by structured reporting

**Repository Purpose**

This repository demonstrates enterprise-grade QA documentation and governance practices, including:

- Business and functional requirement artifacts

- Sprint-based test case design

- Defect management and metrics tracking

- Risk assessment and mitigation planning

- Agile ceremony documentation

- Traceability and release governance artifacts

**This simulation mirrors enterprise-grade QA operating models used in large-scale retail and healthcare commerce programs, emphasizing governance, integration integrity, and controlled release management.**
